# Tournament-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot intended for use for MNCS tournaments to get match times and manage players. In progress and my not be finished due to my own laziness.


uses a api to do all of the heavy lifting and a discord bots calls the api
gives a lot more freedom for coding and not everything will be in the discord python file
