# Tournament-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot intended for use for MNCS tournaments to get match times and manage players. In progress and my not be finished due to my own laziness.


uses a api to do all of the heavy lifting and a discord bots calls the api
gives a lot more freedom for coding and not everything will be in the discord python file


use run.bat to start the api, it will run at localhost, use the link in the console and go to /docs to interact

bot join url : https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1038641710835703808&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands


This will be revamped in due time
