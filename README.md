# Tournament-Discord-Bot
This is a discord bot intended for use for MNCS tournaments to get match times and manage players. In progress and may not be finished due to my own laziness. Nevermind its in v1


Uses a api to do all of the heavy lifting and a discord bot calls the api
Gives a lot more freedom for coding and not everything will be in the discord python file, could add a website that pulls data from api as well, but f*** html


use run.bat to start the api, it will run at localhost, use the link in the console and go to /docs to interact, quite a good system
   May need to change the cd command to where ever you store this project


bot join url : https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1038641710835703808&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands

Testing Discord Join Link : https://discord.gg/QmXCCRPBJz
  feel free to join if you want, 
  If you need help with what ever then join this discord and ping me (The admin)


This will be revamped in due time
